## Description

Motivation? Why build? Problem solved? Learned what?

This is a back-end application for an e-commerce site. This app will take users' requests to retrieve, post, update, and delete information from an SQL database through the use of an Express.js API. Sequelize is used as an ORM that will take requests to the server, convert them into MySQL queries, and respond with the (possibly modified) responses to those queries.

This simplified the process of CRUD queries/requests to the e-commerce database, and could be readily integrated with the frontend piece of the site. Data would then only need to be formatted and displayed to the user in a dynamic and user-friendly manner.

I learned/practiced the following technologies/skills/concepts through the development of this application:

### Technologies

- Express.js (web app framework)
- Sequelize (ORM)
- MySQL
- dotenv (npm package)
- mysql2 (npm package)
- Insomnia

### Skills/Concepts

- ORM implementation: building models to create MySQL tables/ table relationships
- RESTful routing
- Many-to-many table relationships
- Asynchronicity: async/await functions
